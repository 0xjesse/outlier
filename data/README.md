# Data

The `charts.csv` file contains the metadata for each chart. The combination of segment, metric, and aggregation determines the desired chart selected by the users.

The `queries.csv` file contains the query id for each chart. The result of each query will be pulled as a JSON file by the app and saved on the respective CSV file.
